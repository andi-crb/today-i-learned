# today-i-learned

I recently graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy and I'm determined to keep learning. This is a repository to record at least one thing I learned each day, however simple or straightforward it is.

<h2>Ruby</h2>
- Use of .chomp to remove the blank line from input (6/4/16)
- Use of each, times and iteration. (7/4/16)
- How to iterate through a Hash. (8/4/16)

This idea inspired by til repos such as that of <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">jbranchaud</a>
