# today-i-learned

I recently graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy and I'm determined to keep learning. This is a repository to record at least one thing I learned each day, however simple or straightforward it is.

<h2>Ruby</h2>
- Use of .chomp to remove the blank line from input (6/4/16)
- Use of each, times and iteration. (7/4/16)
- How to iterate through a Hash. (8/4/16)
- How to sort an array. (11/04/16)
- How to define and call methods. (12/04/16)

<h2>SQL</h2>
- An overview of some of SQL server's new features. (9/4/16)

<h2>HTML<h2>
- That I need a better MS Word to HTML converter! (10/4/16)

This idea inspired by til repos such as that of <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">jbranchaud</a>
