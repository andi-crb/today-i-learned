# today-i-learned

I recently graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy and I'm determined to keep learning. This is a repository to record at least one thing I learned each day, however simple or straightforward it might be.

<h2>Ruby</h2>
- Use of .chomp to remove the blank line from input (6/4/16)
- Use of each, times and iteration. (7/4/16)
- How to iterate through a Hash. (8/4/16)
- How to sort an array. (11/04/16)
- How to define and call methods. (12/04/16)
- Ways to refactor code, including single line if statements and use of the ternary operator. (14/4/16)
- What a lambda is (sort of!). (15/04/16)
- What inheritance is and how it works. (16/04/16)

<h2>SQL</h2>
- An overview of some of SQL server's new features. (9/4/16)

<h2>HTML</h2>
- That I need a better MS Word to HTML converter! (10/4/16)

<h2>General/Other</h2>
- That sometimes life gets in the way of learning. (13/4/16)

This idea inspired by til repos such as that of <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">jbranchaud</a>
